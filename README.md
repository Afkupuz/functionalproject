# functionalproject

Staring at black on white text all day gets to me, so I decided to build something that is useful, then expanded on it

This project was intended for my class work, reading text on a laptop for hours would be so much easier with sepia or maybe other colors

I decided it would be nice to be able to save key words that interested me, so I added a notebook functionality.
